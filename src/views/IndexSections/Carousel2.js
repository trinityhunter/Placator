                MOTIVATION FOR WORK:
              </h1>
              <p className="lead text-white mt-4">
                Most of the area was covered by thick forest until a few years
                ago.  The Odisha District Gazetteers report that between 1931
                and 2008, there was a drop of 23.1% in the amount of forest
                cover, indicating significant deforestation in the region as a
                result of urbanization, industrialization, and natural
                disasters. The population are forced to migrate as a forced
                survival strategy as a result of the effects of deforestation.
              </p>
              <p className="lead text-white mt-4">
                Additionally, this has 10 caused climatic changes in the area,
                resulting in erratic rain patterns and having a detrimental
                effect on the local population&#39;s economy. The deforestation
                problem faced by Odisha motivated us to find a solution which
                would reduce the degradation of planted samplings thus
                increasing the forest are and economy indirectly.
